# DeepFake Audio Detection using VGG16

This project implements a deep learning approach to detect tampered (spoofed) audio using Mel-spectrogram representations and the VGG16 convolutional neural network architecture. It is trained on the CMFD dataset and tested for generalization on a diverse in-the-wild dataset.

## 🔧 Requirements

Install the following dependencies before running the code:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn librosa scikit-learn tensorflow
```

Ensure you're using:
- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- A system with sufficient memory/GPU is recommended for model training.

## 🚀 Project Overview

### Preprocessing
- Converts `.wav` files into Mel-spectrograms of size `(128, 128)` or resized to `(224, 224)` for compatibility with VGG16.
- Normalizes and pads audio as needed for uniform input.

### Model
- VGG16 CNN architecture (ImageNet pretrained, fine-tuned on spectrograms).
- Custom classification head with `Dense`, `Dropout`, and `Softmax` layers.

### Evaluation
- Metrics: Accuracy, AUC-ROC, Confusion Matrix.
- Tested on both in-domain (CMFD) and out-of-domain (In-the-Wild) data.
